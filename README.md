### Fonts
I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Merienda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merienda?preview.text=Golf%20Classic&query=merienda) as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look.

### Icons

I will used some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will be used where there is no explination needed to their meaning, like the social media links and the hamburger icon for navigational links on smaller devices. Other icons will be use for style to the prize section.

### Colours

I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors") to help in the selection of my colour scheme.

![Colour Pallet](wireframes/Project_colors.png)

- #6e9075ff - This colour will be used as the main background colour.
- #2b1679ff - This colour will be used as the text colour.
- #F5F5F5 - This colour will be used as a backgroung behind images in the Prize section.
- #3a3a3a - This colour will be used for box shadow.

### Structure

I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the Galaxy Fold (280px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Wireframes

I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially had three pages for my website but changed to one, this gets the user through the content quickly by access to the registration form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:

### [Desktop Wireframe](wireframes/Desktop%20Wireframe.png "Desktop wireframe")

### [Tablet Wireframe](wireframes/Tablet%20Wireframe.png "Tablet wireframe")

### [Phone Wireframe](wireframes/Phone%20Wireframe.png "Phone wireframe")

# Features

## Existing Features

### Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is fully responsive to allow for various screen sizes. It includes links to manover around the site easily and the competetion header doubles as a link back to the home screen.

+ Large Desktop screens (>=992px)
\
&nbsp;
        ![Navigation bar](wireframes/Header_large.png)
    -   Spanning the full width of the device and with all navigational links (Home, Gallery, Play Golf (Registration page), this gives ease and clear use to the end user.

    -   In order for the user to visably see which of the links they are hovering over there is a bar below the text.
