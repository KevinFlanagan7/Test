### Fonts
I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Merienda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merienda?preview.text=Golf%20Classic&query=merienda) as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look.

### Icons

I will used some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will be used where there is no explination needed to their meaning, like the social media links and the hamburger icon for navigational links on smaller devices. Other icons will be use for style to the prize section.

### Colours

I have used [Coolers](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors") to help in the selection of my colour scheme. I changed colours as initial heading colours had poor contract with the background. After manually optimizing it improved contrast with backgroud colours used. I used coolers contrast checker, results for green background can been viewed [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-6e9075 "Adjusted colour") and for the white background can be viewed [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-f5f5f5 "Adjusted colour").

![Colour Pallet](wireframes/Project_colors.png)

- #6e9075ff - This colour will be used as the main background colour.
- #2b1679ff - This colour will be used as the text colour.
- #F5F5F5 - This colour will be used as a backgroung behind images in the Prize section.
- #3a3a3a - This colour will be used for box shadow.

### Structure

I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5 (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Wireframes

I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially had three pages for my website but changed to one, this gets the user through the content quickly by access to the registration form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:

### [Desktop Wireframe](wireframes/Desktop%20Wireframe.png "Desktop wireframe")

### [Tablet Wireframe](wireframes/Tablet%20Wireframe.png "Tablet wireframe")

### [Phone Wireframe](wireframes/Phone%20Wireframe.png "Phone wireframe")

# Features

    - Spanning the full width of the device and with all navigational links (Home, About, Gallery, Sign up (Registration page)), this gives ease and clear use to the end user.

        ![Navigation bar](wireframes/Header_large.png)

    - In order for the user to visably see which of the links they are hovering over there is a bar below the text.

### Landing Page

+ The landing page image
    - The image gives the user instant knowledge of what is involved in the club, and with added animation draws their eye to the site.
    - The text gives instant information to the user on what the club is. With the added animation of fading in slightly behind the image, it makes the user keep interest.

# Testing

 The site responds nicely to all different screen sizes, the images look clean and sharp on all device sizes with very little, large blank spaces. It allows the user to navigate around easily and aslo make contact via the sign up form or social media links. The content is simple and to the point.
\
&nbsp;

    - HTML (index.html) validator [results](wireframes/ "W3C HTML")
    - CSS validator [results](wireframes "W3C CSS")
\
&nbsp;

\
&nbsp;

## Unfixed Bugs
The Hamburger menu selector for smaller devices does not close when a menu is selected. To enable this it would need JavaScript which I have not covered yet.
