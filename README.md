### Fonts
I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to find a text that best suits the feel of the website. For the main text I have chosen [Merienda](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=mon "Montserrat font") as I feel it is has a sharp, simple and easy to read look. 

### Icons

I will used some icons for my website from the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). These icons will be used where there is no explination needed to their meaning like the social media links and a hamburger for navigational links on smaller devices. Other icons will be use for style to the prizes that can be won.

### Colours

I have used [Colourmind](https://colormind.io/ "colourmind") to help in the selection of my colour scheme. 

### Structure

I will be building my website with a mobile first mindset using the iPhone 5/SE (320px) as the smallest screen size for styling to look good on. The screen size breakpoints that I will be using are from [Bootstrap breakpoints](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/breakpoints/ "Bootstrap").

| Screen Size | Breakpoint |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| x-small     | <576px     |
| small       | => 576px   |
| medium      | => 768px   |
| large       | => 992px   |
| x-large     | => 1200px  |

# Wireframes

I have used [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamic") to develop my wireframes for my website. I initially created the mobile version and then the wireframes and then scalled it up for both tablet and desktop. Because a requirement is to give little but quality information to the user to make them want to engage with the club, a one-page website is used. This gets the user through the content and quickly to the contact form and details via scrolling or directly via the navigation bar.

The wireframes are below:

### [Desktop Wireframe]( "Desktop wireframe")

### [Tablet Wireframe]( "Tablet wireframe")

### [Phone Wireframe]( "Phone wireframe")
